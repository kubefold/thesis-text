\chapter{Summary}

Within the project, the following goals were successfully accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and implemented the \textit{KubeFold} operator for the Kubernetes platform.
    \item Created two custom resources (CRDs):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{ProteinDatabase} – managing protein databases,
        \item \textit{ProteinConformationPrediction} – running protein conformation prediction computations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Developed a component for automatic downloading and decompression of protein databases,
    \item Prepared infrastructure as code (IaC) allowing for quick operator deployment in AWS cloud (EKS + FSx for Lustre),
    \item Created documentation and installation instructions for the Kubernetes operator,
    \item Conducted several protein conformation computations to test the solution.
\end{itemize}
